/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const Analysis = "In this step developers should determine what the application is supposed to do and its requirement."
const Design = "This step focus more on  design the phase of software application like architecture, user interface  platforms."
const Implementation ="This is the actual writing of the program. A small project might be written by a single developer, while a large project might be broken up and worked by several teams."
const Testing ="It’s critical to test an application before making it available to users. Much of the testing can be automated, like security testing. Other testing can only be done in a specific environmen."
const Maintain="In this phase, users discover bugs that weren’t found during testing. These errors need to be resolved, which can spawn new development cycles"
